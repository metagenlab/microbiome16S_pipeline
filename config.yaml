## Dataset ############################################################################################################
### Set input samples list. (Mandatory, one of them or both)
link_directory: links # links by default.
sra_samples: example_sra_samples.tsv ## To access to Sequences Read Archive
local_samples: example_local_samples.tsv ## Local analysis

### Metadata columns definition
run_column: seq_run # Column identifying the sequencing run (sequencing error are learned for each run with DADA2)
grouping_column: ["sample_group"] # Column for which a plot (e.g. KRONA page), will be generated for each value of.
sample_label: sample_label # Column in "local_samples" used to label samples in output. Cannot be the first column and must be unique.
sample_type: sample_source # Column in "local_samples" used to color points and fill plots.
ordination_factor : sample_source # Column in "local_samples" used to for shapes of points in ordination.
filter_meta_column: Sample # A column from which we could filter in samples
filter_column_value: A549-PCR-neg-20180809 # Value of filtered in samples of this column
amplicons_refpath_seq: "/media/master_students/DATA/labbooks/Charlotte/20190722_snakemake_DB/amplicons_reference_seq.fasta"  # File path amplicons_reference_seq.fasta
sample: ['20180718_MOCK_MN_Illumina','20180718_MOCK_MN_Qiagen'] # Mock community sample in local_sample

## Reads proccessing ##################################################################################################
### Choose the denoising approach, either the "vsearch" to generate classical 97% identity OTUs or the "DADA2" for errors corrected 100% ASVs
denoiser: ["vsearch", "DADA2"] # "vsearch", "DADA2" or both

### PCR primers trimming sequences (with PANDAseq for vsearch approach and Cutadapt for DADA2)
forward_primer: CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG # CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG for Illumina V3V4
reverse_primer: GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC # GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC for Illumina V3V4

### Length trimming of reads (after primer removal, for DADA2 approach only)
DADA2_F_reads_length_trim: 280 # 280 recommended to remove low quality ends of R1. Must be < than read_length - trimmed_primer_length
DADA2_R_reads_length_trim: 255 # 250 recommended to remove low quality ends of R2. Must be < than read_length - trimmed_primer_length

### Quality-based filtering of reads (reads trimming, for DADA2 approach only)
F_extected_error: 6 # 6 recommended, increase if too much reads are filtered out. Apply to DADA2 approach only
R_extected_error: 6 # 6 recommended, increase if too much reads are filtered out. Apply to DADA2 approach only

### Merged sequences length-based filtering (appied to DADA2 and vsearch approaches)
merged_min_length: 390 # from 390 to 400 for V3V4
merged_max_length: 500 # from 450 to 500 for V3V4

### Database used for taxonomic assignment
tax_DB: ["ezbiocloud_valentin"] # must be the name of the folder containing files named "EzBioCloud_V3V4.fasta" and "EzBioCloud_V3V4_taxonomy.txt" in /data/. Can be multiple.


## Reads post-processing ##############################################################################################
### Rarefaction
rarefaction_value: [10000,20000,300000] # value for rarefaction. 20000 is generally enough reads but must be assessed by rarefaction curve.
viz_replace_empty_tax: TRUE # "TRUE" is recommended to replace empty taxonomic levels by "_sp" for species, "_g" for the genus etc.... Otherwise they are left empty
filter_tax_rank: ["Kingdom"] # At which taxonomic rank we filter in. (Usually "Kingdom")
filter_lineage: ["Bacteria"] # What value of filter_tax_rank we keep. (Usually "Bacteria")
filter_out_tax_rank: ["Phylum"] # At which taxonomic rank we filter out. (Usually "Phylum")
filter_out_lineage: ["Bacteria_phy"] # Which value of filter_out_tax_rank we filter out. (Usually "Bacteria_phy" to remove suspicious sequences assigned as Bacteria but which are probably not.
