## Use Docker image with singularity, if "--use-singularity" is used in snakemake command

## Input/output
### Include logging rules
include: "rules/0_preprocessing/logging.rules"
## Include rules and functions to set input/output
include: "rules/0_preprocessing/make_output_list_files.rules"


## Rules to call defined sets of output. For each, we first generate a function calling the combined list of output. Then its is integrated in a easily callable rule
### Defaul rule all. Include all but PICRUSt2
rule all:
    input: rule_all_list()
### Only QC of the reads
rule QC:
    input: MultiQC
    priority: 50

### Light output, including count table, consensus sequences and taxonomic assignement
rule light_output:
    input: light_output_list()
    priority: 49

### Basic output, generated plots numbers, KRONA plots and rarefaction curve
rule basic_output:
    input: basic_plots_list()
    priority: 48

### Qiime2 outputs
rule Qiime2_output:
    input: Qiime2_output_list()
    priority: 47

### Complete set of phyloseq, in option including transposed count table and metadata (wide to long)
rule phyloseq_output:
    input: phyloseq_output_list()
    priority: 46

### Complete set of plots
rule plots_output:
    input: plots_output_list()
    priority: 45

### PICRUSt2 outputs
rule PICRUSt2_output:
    input: PICRUSt2_list()
    priority: 0
