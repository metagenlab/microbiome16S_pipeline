## Path to the input database files
DBpath_seq: "/home/master_students/bin/microbiome16S_pipeline/data/ezbiocloud201805/DB_amp.fasta" # reference genomic sequence in .fasta format
DBpath_tax: "/home/master_students/bin/microbiome16S_pipeline/data/ezbiocloud201805/DB_amp_taxonomy.txt" # reference taxonomy of these sequences. 

## Output
tax_DB_path: "/data/databases/amplicon_based_metagenomics/16S/" # path where to write the output of the database processing pipeline. 
tax_DB_name: "EzBioCloud_version" # desired name of processed database (name of the directory which will contain the output)

## Amplicons extraction
forward_primer: CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG # the forward PCR primer used to extract the amplicon
reverse_primer: GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC # the reverse PCR primer used to extract the amplicon
amplicon_min_length: 300 # the min length of the amplicon
amplicon_max_length: 500 # the max length of the amplicon
excepted_errors: 4 # the accepted number of mistmach per primer
amplicon_min_coverage: 0.9 # the proportion of the primers that must be found in the reference sequences. 

## Taxa collapsing
numbers_species: 4 # the max number of species names to be pasted together. Over this number, taxonomic names will be replaced by a space holder. 
numbers_genus: 2 # the max number of genus names to be pasted together. Over this number, taxonomic names will be replaced by a space holder.
